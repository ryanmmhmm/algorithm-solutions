# algorithm-solutions
A set of solutions to different algorithmic based questions to practice computer science based skills

## How to use:
- Bundle install from main directory
- Most solution sets are built with minitest which can be run with the `rake` command from the directory of the algorithm
- There are multiple ways to solve each problem, so there may be many solutions in each directory

## Focus:
The focus here is to practice soltutions from CS fundamentals using language agnostic programming patterns.

Although a lot of the solutions are written in Ruby, they are not completed in a _Ruby-Way_ with _Ruby-favoured_ syntax.

The languaged agnostic patterns (for loops, etc.) are used to allow programmers and viewers of the repo to be able to interpret the solutions into their own language sets without having to have a core understanding of the Ruby stdlib.

That being said, I intend to add solutions completed in the _Ruby-Way_ with better use of enumeration to practice and improve my development skills as a Ruby programmer.

Thought has been put into _BigO_ notation for devising better solutions to the problems that have been tackled.  Often there will be only one test file in the folder for a solution to a problem that best represents my thoughts on the way that something should be done (for better or for worse!).

## Remember:
Algorthims are a great way to learn more about the science behind why _Tried-Tested-and-True_ techniques and methodologies exist.  They exist to make computer programs more efficient and make us all better programmers through osmosis.

Have fun with them, don't be afraid to have a solution that isn't the best, and most importantly LEARN!
